# Quiz App React + Vite

##About
This project is a solo project from Scrimba.
After taking the React Fundamental course there, this quiz app is an assignment to practice our newly learned React skills.

##Requirments:

- Two Screens (start and questions)
- Fetch questions from OTDB API
- Tally correct answers after "Checked answers" button is clicked
- Style and polish app to match the given figma design

##Things I learned during this project:

- Deal with HTML entities, had to use the 'he' package to decode the questions and answers
- Style radio buttons so they don't look like a radio anymore
- Track the selected answer index inside each question object
